Project Description: This game requires to try to clean all the teeth before the timer runs out and see how far they can get. As this was a class about Game Design, we had to come up with multiple concepts throughout the term and create one of those concepts. I chose the game One Minute Brush for two reasons. I like the idea to gameify am daily activity and it was light on visual assets and created them all by myself.

Challenges: As this concept was about gameifying an regular activity, it was not easy to find an activity and then also build and try different versions of that activity to find which one is the most fun.

Lessons Learned: I learned to approach design more as an exploration with testing and revising ideas. My earlier projects were mostly fleshed out in my head and I build them as imagined.
